# Bleeding Edge
### This mod is better with [Server-Side-Scythes](https://modrinth.com/mod/server-side-scythes)!



This mod adds a **brand new enchantment; Bleeding Edge;** which allows you to harvest blood; a new consumable that is eaten fast for a small amount of nutrition and saturation; for various uses.

This mod is **100%** serverside with a custom resource pack, meaning players with vannila clients or [Geyser](https://modrinth.com/plugin/geyser) can still play properly!

## New Items

- Blood
- Blood Block
- Blood Eye
    - Reveals all nearby entities with glowing when used
- Blood Apple
  - An inversed Golden Apple, giving you harmful effects.
- Potion Syringe
  - A syringe you can fill up with all of your effects, than use for later or hit an enemy with.

### Blood Scythe ([Requires Scythes](https://modrinth.com/mod/server-side-scythes))
A new Scythe that slowly drains life from your opponents after being hit.

You may also get some errors when not using Server-Side Scythes. You can safely ignore this, as it's just trying to add the scythe to recipes although it doesn't exist.

## Resource Pack
- Install [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) (you may already have it installed as a dependency)
- Follow [this guide](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/) for up-to-date details on how to host your pack for your specific scenario.

### Bedrock / Geyser

Bedrock players may see blood as steak.

Bedrock support not tested.

## Recipes

Recipes are available in-game after obtaining Blood from the Bleeding Edge enchantment. (or gaining a stick for the blood scythe)
